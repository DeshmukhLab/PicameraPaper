The picamera package consists of several modules which provide a pure Python
interface to the Raspberry Pi's camera module. The package is only intended to
run on a Raspberry Pi, and expects to be able to load the MMAL library
(libmmal.so) upon import.

The classes defined by most modules in this package are available directly from
the :mod:`picamera` namespace. In other words, the following code is typically
all that is required to access classes in the package::

    import picamera

The :mod:`picamera.array` module is an exception to this as it depends on the
third-party `numpy`_ package (this avoids making numpy a mandatory dependency
for picamera).

.. _numpy: http://www.numpy.org/


The following sections document the various modules available within the
package:

* :mod:`picamera.camera`
* :mod:`picamera.encoders`
* :mod:`picamera.frames`
* :mod:`picamera.streams`
* :mod:`picamera.renderers`
* :mod:`picamera.color`
* :mod:`picamera.exc`
* :mod:`picamera.array`
