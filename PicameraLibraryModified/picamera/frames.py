    This class simply defines constants used to represent the type of a frame
    in :attr:`PiVideoFrame.frame_type`. Effectively it is a namespace for an
    enum.

    .. attribute:: frame

        Indicates a predicted frame (P-frame). This is the most common frame
        type.

    .. attribute:: key_frame

        Indicates an intra-frame (I-frame) also known as a key frame.

    .. attribute:: sps_header

        Indicates an inline SPS/PPS header (rather than picture data) which is
        typically used as a split point.

    .. attribute:: motion_data

        Indicates the frame is inline motion vector data, rather than picture
        data.

    'split_size',    # the size (in bytes) of the video since the last split

    This class is a namedtuple derivative used to store information about a
    video frame. It is recommended that you access the information stored by
    this class by attribute name rather than position (for example:
    ``frame.index`` rather than ``frame[0]``).

    .. attribute:: index

        Returns the zero-based number of the frame. This is a monotonic counter
        that is simply incremented every time the camera starts outputting a
        new frame. As a consequence, this attribute cannot be used to detect
        dropped frames. Nor does it necessarily represent actual frames; it
        will be incremented for SPS headers and motion data buffers too.

    .. attribute:: frame_type

        Returns a constant indicating the kind of data that the frame contains
        (see :class:`PiVideoFrameType`). Please note that certain frame types
        contain no image data at all.

    .. attribute:: frame_size

        Returns the size in bytes of the current frame. If a frame is written
        in multiple chunks, this value will increment while :attr:`index`
        remains static. Query :attr:`complete` to determine whether the frame
        has been completely output yet.

    .. attribute:: video_size

        Returns the size in bytes of the entire video up to the current frame.
        Note that this is unlikely to match the size of the actual file/stream
        written so far. This is because a stream may utilize buffering which
        will cause the actual amount written (e.g. to disk) to lag behind the
        value reported by this attribute.

    .. attribute:: split_size

        Returns the size in bytes of the video recorded since the last call to
        either :meth:`~PiCamera.start_recording` or
        :meth:`~PiCamera.split_recording`. For the reasons explained above,
        this may differ from the size of the actual file/stream written so far.

    .. attribute:: timestamp

        Returns the presentation timestamp (PTS) of the current frame as
        reported by the encoder. When the camera's clock mode is ``'reset'``
        (the default), this is the number of microseconds (millionths of a
        second) since video recording started. When the camera's
        :attr:`~PiCamera.clock_mode` is ``'raw'``, this is the number of
        microseconds since the last system reboot. See
        :attr:`~PiCamera.timestamp` for more information.

        .. warning::

            Currently, the video encoder occasionally returns "time unknown"
            values in this field which picamera represents as ``None``. If you
            are querying this property you will need to check the value is not
            ``None`` before using it.

    .. attribute:: complete

        Returns a bool indicating whether the current frame is complete or not.
        If the frame is complete then :attr:`frame_size` will not increment
        any further, and will reset for the next frame.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.5
        Deprecated :attr:`header` and :attr:`keyframe` attributes and added the
        new :attr:`frame_type` attribute instead.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9
        Added the :attr:`complete` attribute.
